With contract meaning it contains founded abstractions and can be consumed by the higher calling stack (context) e.g. CI and the state of a contract is transferred via env vars.

```shell 
NORBIX_KUBECONFIG='/tmp/resources/kind_provisioner/config.yaml' ./main.sh provision TEST
```

Without contract by using only params.

```shell 
./main.sh provision TEST
```
